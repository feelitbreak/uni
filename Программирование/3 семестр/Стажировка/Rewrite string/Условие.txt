Important: do not use packages; output files must NOT contain blank lines in the end.



Precondition:

The "input.txt" file contains not empty string in lower case



Task:

1) Read string from the "input.txt" file

2) Remove characters from the string that are repeated maximum number of times

3) If all characters are repeated the same number of times - keep the string as is

4) Print the result string to the "output1.txt" file

5) In the "output2.txt" file print each character of initial string and number of times it was repeated (in format "a:3"). These records must be separated with space and sorted by number of repetitions from greatest to lowest (if 2 characters have same number of repetitions - sort by character's code in ascending order).



Note:

Check the "input.txt", "output1.txt" and "output2.txt" files in "Tests" tab for an example
